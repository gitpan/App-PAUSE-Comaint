=head1 NAME

comaint - Make someone comaint of your module on PAUSE

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  comaint App::ForkProve FLORA

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<comaint> is a command-line script to automate the process of logging
in to PAUSE and making other PAUSE author as a co-maintainer of your
module.

The script will automatically fetch the list of packages included in
the distribution that your given module belongs to. For example, if you run:

  comaint Plack::Middleware::ReverseProxy MIYAGAWA

it will gather all packages included in the
Plack-Middleware-ReverseProxy distribution, and try to make MIYAGAWA
as a comaint for all of them.

The script is written in a defensive manner so that if you specify a
module that you don't have a primary maintainership on, it will complain
about that.

There's also a prompt before actually making someone a co-maint.

=head1 PREREQUISITES

=over 4

=item *

You have to have a CPAN mirror cache in C<~/.cpanm> to find the
related packages. You can run `cpanm --mirror-only strict` once to get
that cache.

=item *

Your PAUSE credentials have to be saved in C<~/.pause> file, the same
as the one used by CPAN uploader.
